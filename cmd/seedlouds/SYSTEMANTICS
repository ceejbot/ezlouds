‚Äè"IF YOU ARE NOT PART OF THE SOLUTION, YOU ARE PART OF THE PROBLEM."
"THIS SYSTEM IS THE ONLY CORRECT SYSTEM."
(A) YOU CAN'T CHANGE JUST ONE THING. (B) YOU CAN'T CHANGE EVERYHING.
A BUG MAY BE PURELY LOCAL, BUT YOU AND I CAN NEVER KNOW THAT FOR SURE.
A COMPLEX SYSTEM DESIGNED FROM SCRATCH NEVER WORKS AND CAN'T BE MADE TO WORK. YOU HAVE TO START OVER, BEGINNING WITH A SIMPLE WORKING SYSTEM
A COMPLEX SYSTEM THAT WORKS IN INVARIABLY FOUND TO HABE EVOLVED FROM A SIMPLE SYSTEM THAT WORKED.
A LARGE SYSTEM PRODUCED BY EXPANDING THE DIMENSIONS OF A SMALLER SYSTEM DOES NOT BEHAVE LIKE THE SMALLER SYSTEM.
A LITTLE GRANDIOSITY GOES A LONG WAY.
A SIMPLE SYSTEM MAY OR MAY NOT WORK.
A SYSTEM CAN FAIL IN AN INFINITE NUMBER OF WAYS.
A SYSTEM IS NO BETTER THAN ITS SENSORY ORGANS.
A SYSTEM THAT IGNORES FEEDBACK HAS ALREADY BEGUN THE PROCESS OF TERMINAL INSTABILITY.
A SYSTEM THAT PERFORMS A CERTAIN FUNCTION OR THAT OPERATES IN A CERTAIN WAY WILL CONTINUE TO OPERATE IN THAT WAY REGARDLESS OF THE NEED OR OF CHANGED CONDITIONS.
A TEMPORARY PATCH WILL VERY LIKELY BE PERMANENT.
A TOTAL SYSTEM IN A RUNAWAY SEQUENCE MAY BE FORCED TO GROW RAPIDLY OR DISINTEGRATE INTO CHAOS.
ADDING MANPOWER TO A LATE SOFTWARE PROJECT MAKES IT LATER.
ADDING NUMBERS TO A BAD STUDY DOESN'T CLARIFY IT.
ALMOST ANYTHING IS EASIER TO GET INTO THAN OUT OF.
ANY GIVEN ELEMENT OF ONE SYSTEM IS SIMULTANEOUSLY AN ELEMENT IN AN INFINITY OF OTHER SYSTEMS.
ANY LARGE SYSTEM IS GOING TO BE OPERATING MOST OF THE TIME IN FAILURE MODE.
AS SYSTEMS EXPAND, NEW FUNCTIONS APPEAR SUDDENLY, IN STEPWISE FASHION.
AS SYSTEMS GROW IN SIZE AND COMPLEXITY, THEY TEND TO LOSE BASIC FUNCTIONS.
AVOID UNFAVOURABLE SETTINGS (SOME THINGS JUST CAN'T BE DONE WELL BY A SYSTEM)
AVOID UNNECCESARY SYSTEMS (SYSTEMS SHOULD NOT BE UNNECESSARILY MULTIPLIED).
AVOID UPHILL CONFIGURATIONS (SYSTEMS RUN DOWNHILL MORE EASILY THAN UPHILL).
BAD DESIGN CAN RARELY BE OVERCOME BY MORE DESIGN, WHETHER GOOD OR BAD.
BEWARE OF POSITIVE FEEDBACK.
BIG SYSTEMS EITHER WORK ON THEIR OWN OR THEY DON'T. IF THEY DON'T, YOU CAN'T MAKE THEM.
CHERISH YOUR BUGS. STUDY THEM.
CHOOSE YOUR SYSTEMS WITH CARE.
COLOSSAL SYSTEMS FOSTER COLOSSAL ERRORS.
COLOSSAL ERRORS TEND TO ESCAPE NOTICE.
COMPLEX SYSTEMS EXHIBIT UNEXPECTED BEHAVIOR.
COMPLEX SYSTEMS HAVE COMPLEX BEHAVIORS.
COMPLICATED SYSTEMS PRODUCE COMPLICATED RESPONSES TO PROBLEMS.
CONTROL IS EXERCISED BY THE ELEMENT WITH THE GREATEST VARIETY OF BEHAVIORAL RESPONSES
Correct Form of the Above: THE SOLUTION IS OFTEN PART OF THE PROBLEM
DESIGNERS OF SYSTEMS TEND TO DESIGN WAYS FOR THEMSELVES TO BYPASS THE SYSTEM.
DESTINY IS LARGELY A SET OF UNQUESTIONED ASSUMPTIONS.
DO ALMOST ANYTHING ELSE.
DO IT WITH A LITTLE SYSTEM IF YOU CAN.
DO IT WITH AN EXISTING SYSTEM IF YOU CAN.
DO IT WITHOUT A NEW SYSTEM IF YOU CAN.
DON'T BOTHER TO LOOK FOR IT. YOU WON'T FIND IT.
DON'T PUT YOUR NAME ON IT UNTIL YOU ARE SURE IT WILL FLOAT.
ERROR CORRECTION IS WHAT WE DO.
ESCALATING THE WRONG SOLUTION DOES NOT IMPROVE THE OUTCOME.
EVEN TRYING TO BE HELPFUL IS A DELICATE AND DANGEROUS UNDERTAKING.
EVERY PICTURE TELLS A STORY - BUT NOT THE SAME STORY.
EVERYTHING CORRELATES.
EXPERIENCE ISN'T HEREDITARY. IT AIN'T EVEN CONTAGIOUS.
EXTRA BRAIN IN TAIL, TAIL WAGS ON OWN SCHEDULE.
FEEDBACK ALWAYS GIVES A PICTURE OF THE PAST (INFORMATION TRAVELS AT FINITE VELOCITY)
FOR MAXIMUM SUCCESS, FEEL FREE TO SWITCH SYSTEMS AND EVEN TO CHANGE GOALS.
FORM MAY FOLLOW FUNCTION, BUT DON'T COUNT ON IT.
GO WITH THE FLOW.
GREAT ADVANCES DO NOT COME OUT OF SYSTEMS DESIGNED TO PRODUCE GREAT ADVANCES.
I. THE MOST EFFECTIVE APPROACH TO COPING IS TO LEARN THE LAWS OF SYSTEMS-BEHAVIOR.
IF A PROBLEM SEEMS UNSOLVABLE, CONSIDER THAT YOU MAY HAVE A META-PROBLEM
IF A SYSTEM CAN BE EXPLOITED, IT WILL BE EXPLOITED.
IF A SYSTEM IS WORKING, LEAVE IT ALONE, DON'T CHANGE ANYTHING. (IF IT AIN'T BROKE DON'T FIX IT.)
IF DETROIT MAKES IT, IT MUST BE AN AUTOMOBILE.
IF IT DIDN'T HAPPEN ON CAMERA, IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.
IF IT DOESN'T FAIL HERE, IT WILL FAIL THERE.
IF IT ISN'T OFFICIAL, IT HASN'T HAPPENED.
IF IT LOOKS LIKE A SHOVEL, TRY USING IT FOR DIGGING A HOLE.
IF IT PUTS A WEAPON IN YOUR HAND IT IS AIMING AT SOME KIND OF VIOLENCE.
IF IT'S FOR DIGGING A HOLE IT SHOULD PROBABLY LOOK SOMETHING LIKE A SHOVEL
IF IT'S NOT WORTH DOING, IT'S WORTH DOING WELL.
IF IT'S TREATED BY DOCTORS IT MUST BE A DISEASE.
IF IT'S WORTH DOING AT ALL, IT'S WORTH DOING POORLY.
IF SOMETHING ISN'T WORKING, DON'T KEEP DOING IT. DO SOMETHING ELSE INSTEAD.
IF THE SYSTEM SAYS IT HAPPENED, IT HAPPENED.
IF THINGS ARE ACTING VERY STRANGELY, CONSIDER THAT YOU MAY BE IN A FEEDBACK SITUATION.
IF THINGS SEEM TO BE GETTING WORSE EVEN FASTER THAN USUAL, CONSIDER THAT THE REMEDY MAY BE AT FAULT.
IF YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE SYSTEM, CHANGE THE FRAME - IT COMES TO THE SAME THING.
IF YOU OBVIOUSLY CAN'T DO IT YOU PROBABLY WON'T BE ASKED.
IF YOU'RE NOT AWARE THAT YOU HAVE A PROBLEM, HOW CAN YOU CALL FOR HELP?
IF YOU'RE NOT THERE, THE ACCIDENT CAN HAPPEN WITHOUT YOU.
II. CHOOSE YOUR SYSTEMS WITH CARE. YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO JOIN THE COAST GUARD.
III. FOR MAXIMUM SUCCESS, FEEL FREE TO SWITCH SYSTEMS OR EVEN TO SWITCH GOALS.
IN A CLOSED SYSTEM, INFORMATION TENDS TO DECREASE AND HALLUCINATION TO INCREASE.
IN COMPLEX SYSTEMS, MALFUNCTION AND EVEN TOTAL NON-FUNCTION MAY NOT BE DETECTABLE FOR LONG PERIODS, IF EVER
IN DEALING WITH LARGE SYSTEMS, THE STRIVING FOR PERFECTION IS A SERIOUS IMPERFECTION.
IN DEALING WITH THE SHAPE OF THINGS TO COME, IT PAYS TO BE GOOD AT RECOGNIZING SHAPES.
IN MOST CASES, YOU CAN'T GET THERE FROM HERE
IN ORDER TO BE EFFECTIVE, AN INTERVENTION MUST INTRODUCE A CHANGE AT THE CORRECT LOGICAL LEVEL
IN ORDER TO REMAIN UNCHANGED, THE SYSTEM MUST CHANGE.
IN ORDER TO SUCCEED IT IS NECESSARY TO KNOW HOW TO AVOID THE MOST LIKELY WAYS TO FAIL.
IN SETTING UP A NEW SYSTEM, TREAD SOFTLY. YOU MAY BE DISTURBING ANOTHER SYSTEM THAT IS ACTUALLY WORKING.
INFORMATION DECAYS.
INFORMATION RARELY LEAKS UP.
INTERMITTENT FAILURE IS THE HARDEST CASE.
INTRASYSTEM GOALS COME FIRST.
IT HASN'T FED BACK UNTIL THE SYSTEM CHANGES COURSE.
IV. UTILIZE THE PRINCIPLE OF UTILIZATION.
JUST CALLING IT 'FEEDBACK' DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT HAS ACTUALLY FED BACK.
KEEP IT IN THE STUDY PHASE.
KEEP THE STUDY UNDER STUDY.
KNOWLEDGE DOES NOT KEEP ANY BETTER THAN FISH.
KNOWLEDGE FOR WHAT?
LARGE AMOUNTS OF POOR DATA TEND TO PREEMPT ANY AMOUNT OF GOOD DATA.
LARGE COMPLEX SYSTEMS ARE BEYOND HUMAN CAPACITY TO EVALUATE. (LARGE SYSTEMS KANT BE FULLY KNOWN).
LOOK FOR THE SELF-REFERENTIAL POINT. THAT'S WHERE THE PROBLEM IS LIKELY TO BE.
LOOSE SYSTEMS HAVE LARGER INTERSTICES.
LOOSE SYSTEMS LAST LONGER AND FUNCTION BETTER.
MAJOR ADVANCES TAKE PLACE BY FITS AND STARTS.
